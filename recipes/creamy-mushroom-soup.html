        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I often find amazing mushrooms, both wild and cultivated, at our local farmers market. I've made this soup with cremini, shitake, button, hen of the woods, oyster, chanterelle, and many other local wild types. This soup is velvety and satisfying.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> mixed mushrooms, cleaned, stems separated from caps</li>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> cremini mushrooms, cleaned, stems separated from caps</li>
            <li><strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></strong> cup minced shallot</li>
            <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>6</strong> sprigs thyme</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> sprig rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li><strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup</strong> Cognac</li>
            <li><strong>4 cups</strong> rich homemade chicken stock</li>
            <li><strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup</strong> whipping cream</li>
            <li><strong><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup</strong> chopped chives</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly chop the mushroom stems and simmer them, covered, in the chicken broth for about an hour.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, heat the oil in a large skillet, and saut√© the shallots until transparent. Add the herbs and salt and pepper liberally.</li>
            <li>Beautifully and precisely chop the mushroom caps into a 1/2-inch dice. Add them to the shallots as they are chopped. Keep the heat very low and cook gently until the mushroom liquid is released and reabsorbed. Shake the pan so they don't stick. Remove the thyme and rosemary.</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat and add the Cognac. Flame it if you're feeling really chef-y. Cook the mushroom cap/shallot mixture down (after Cognac) until well-reduced and starting to turn a little golden on the edges.</li>
            <li>Strain the mushroom stems from the chicken broth.</li>
            <li>Add the beautiful mushroom cap and shallot mixture to the strained broth and heat gently.</li>
            <li>Swirl in the cream and chives and serve. Or serve in small sipping cups topped with chives and lightly whipped cream, if you want to get fancy.</li>
        </ol>
