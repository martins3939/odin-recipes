        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is how my grandmother always made tomato soup. It's extremely simple, and relies entirely on extremely red, ripe tomatoes - I only make it if I happen to see tomatoes that look particularly ripe and fresh for sale, not the other way around. It's also very important to use a heavy cast iron pan that is well seasoned, and to get the butter as hot as you can without burning it.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>3 to 4</strong> medium tomatoes</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> butter</li>
            <li><strong>5 or 6 tablespoons</strong> heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Briefly blanche the tomatoes, but do not remove the skin. Cut them in half, scoop out the seeds and slice their backs two or three times each with a sharp knife. Season the halves on each side with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Get the butter sizzling in a cast iron pot, but do not let it brown. Add the tomatoes flesh side down. They are ready to flip when they have sweated a lot of juice, but do not let them burn. It should take about 10 minutes if the heat is correct (medium/low setting).</li>
            <li>Flip the tomatoes on their backs and turn the heat up slightly. Continue cooking about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the pan off the heat, and wait a few seconds for it to cool slightly. Add the cream, and stir like shit with a wooden spoon. You don't want the cream to boil but you want it to come close. After you've gotten everything tasty off the bottom of the pan, you are done - adjust the seasoning, then pour into two bowls.</li>
            <li>You may garnish the soup with some thin strips of basil, or not. Definitely leave it chunky - the mealy texture is important. It is good with crusty Italian bread or with poilane bread.</li>
        </ol>
